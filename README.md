# TalkToAnyone: A Conversational Graph-based Agent

This project allows you to have a conversation with **any person you want**, at **any age you specify**. Under the hood, it uses **LangGraph**, **LangChain** tools, and an LLM to simulate dynamic conversations.

## üì¶ Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graph.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ llm.py
.env
README.md
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **You input who you want to talk to, and at what age.**
2. The system parses the name and age.
3. Then, it simulates a conversation with that person, using the LLM.
4. Optionally, the LLM can call tools (like TavilySearch) to enrich the conversation.
5. The flow is orchestrated by LangGraph.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Edit .env file with your API keys:
   ```
   mv .env.template .env
   # edit .env and add your api keys:
   LLM_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

You'll be prompted:

```
Who do you want to talk to, at what age?
```

For example:

```
Napoleon, 25
```

Then you can chat:

```
User: What do you think about modern warfare?
```

Type quit, exit, or q to end the conversation.
